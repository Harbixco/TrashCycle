          privacy policy. You wanted a brief one, and I provided a more
          comprehensive template. Let's try that again, keeping it much shorter
          and to the point. Brief Privacy Policy At [Your Website Name], we care
          about your privacy. When you use our service to book trash pickups and
          make payments, we collect necessary information like your name,

          your orders and payments. Communicate with you about your service.
